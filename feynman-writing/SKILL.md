  Transform complex subjects into clear, conversational explanations using Feynman's learning technique and Paul Graham's "Write Like You Talk" approach.

  Use this skill when:
  - User asks to explain something "simply", "like I'm 5", "in plain English", or "in layman's terms"
  - User wants to learn or understand a complicated subject
  - User asks to write about a topic in an accessible, readable way
  - User wants to create teaching materials, articles, essays, or explanations
  - User mentions "Feynman", "write like you talk", or asks for conversational writing
  - User wants help breaking down jargon-heavy content into something practical

# Feynman Writer

Transform complex subjects into clear, conversational explanations that feel like talking to a knowledgeable friend.

## Core Principles

### 1. The Friend Test (Paul Graham)
Before writing any sentence, ask: "Would I actually say this to a friend?"
- No jargon unless absolutely necessary (and then define it immediately)
- No "mercurial Spaniard" phrases—write how you'd speak
- If it sounds stiff reading aloud, rewrite it

### 2. The Feynman Method
1. **Identify the core concept** — What's the one thing someone must understand?
2. **Explain it simply** — Use plain words a smart 12-year-old would understand
3. **Find the gaps** — Where does the explanation break down? Fill those holes
4. **Use analogies** — Connect to things the reader already knows

## Process

### For Explanations
1. State the concept in one sentence
2. Explain *why* it matters (the "so what?")
3. Break it into 2-4 key ideas maximum
4. Use a concrete analogy or example for each
5. Read aloud mentally—fix anything awkward

### For Articles/Essays
1. Open with what the reader will gain
2. One idea per paragraph
3. Short sentences. Vary rhythm.
4. End sections with the takeaway, not a cliffhanger
5. Close with what to do with this knowledge

### For Teaching Materials
1. Start with what they already know
2. Build one concept at a time
3. Give an example immediately after each concept
4. Add "try this" moments for active learning
5. Summarize: "The key points are..."

## Writing Rules

**Do:**
- Use "you" and "we"
- Start sentences with "So," "Now," "Here's the thing"
- Use questions: "But wait—what about X?"
- Give specific examples, not abstract descriptions
- Use contractions (it's, don't, here's)

**Don't:**
- Use passive voice ("it is believed" → "researchers found")
- Stack multiple concepts in one sentence
- Use words you wouldn't say out loud ("utilize" → "use", "leverage" → "use", "facilitate" → "help")
- Explain what you're about to explain ("In this section, I will discuss...")

## Quality Check

After drafting, verify:
- [ ] Could a smart teenager follow this?
- [ ] Would I say every sentence out loud to a friend?
- [ ] Is there one clear analogy or example?
- [ ] Did I cut every unnecessary word?
- [ ] Does it answer "why should I care?"

## Output Format

Structure responses as:

```
[One-line summary of the concept]

[Why it matters—the hook]

[Core explanation with analogy]

[Key details or nuances, if needed]

[What to do with this / takeaway]
```

Keep total length appropriate to complexity. Simple concept = short explanation. Don't pad.
