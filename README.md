## Skills

| Skill | Description | How to Use |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| [feynman-writing](feynman-writing/) | Transform complex subjects into clear, conversational explanations using Feynman's technique and Paul Graham's "Write Like You Talk" approach. | Ask the agent to explain something "simply", "like I'm 5", "in plain English", or mention "Feynman" / "write like you talk". Works for teaching materials, articles, essays, and breaking down jargon. |
| [technical-writing](technical-writing/) | Write technical content (tutorials, docs, blog posts) in a warm, Nystrom-inspired style modeled after *Crafting Interpreters*. Approachable without being dumbed down. | Ask to "write a tutorial about X", "explain Y in a friendly way", "create a technical blog post", or "make this documentation more engaging". |
| [design-excellence](design-excellence/) | Automatically apply professional design thinking to any visual output — dashboards, presentations, HTML, PDFs, spreadsheets. References Stripe, Linear, Apple, and Swiss design. | Activates silently whenever the agent creates visual output. No special prompt needed. Includes a reference library with technique catalog, elevation protocol, and interrogation checklist. |
