## Typography Systems

### The Classical Scale
Based on traditional ratios, feels timeless:
```
Base: 16px
Scale: 12 / 14 / 16 / 18 / 21 / 24 / 28 / 32 / 40 / 48 / 64
Ratio: ~1.15 (minor second) to ~1.25 (major third)
```

### The Modern Scale
More dramatic jumps, contemporary feel:
```
Base: 16px
Scale: 12 / 14 / 16 / 20 / 24 / 32 / 48 / 64 / 96
Ratio: ~1.33 (perfect fourth) to ~1.5 (perfect fifth)
```

### Type Pairing Principles
**Contrast without conflict**:
- Geometric sans + Old-style serif (Futura + Garamond)
- Humanist sans + Transitional serif (Gill Sans + Baskerville)
- Neo-grotesque sans + Slab serif (Helvetica + Rockwell)
- Same family, different weights (Inter 400 + Inter 700)

**Safe Professional Pairs**:
- Inter + Source Serif Pro
- IBM Plex Sans + IBM Plex Serif
- Space Grotesk + Newsreader
- DM Sans + DM Serif Display

## Color Philosophy

### Semantic Color Systems
Colors carry meaning. Assign deliberately:
```
Primary: Brand action, main CTA
Secondary: Supporting actions, navigation
Success: Confirmations, positive states (green family)
Warning: Caution states, attention needed (amber/yellow)
Error: Problems, destructive actions (red family)
Info: Neutral information (blue family)
Neutral: Text, backgrounds, borders (gray scale)
```

### Temperature and Mood
**Cool Palette** (blue, gray, green): Professional, trustworthy, calm
**Warm Palette** (orange, yellow, red): Energetic, urgent, friendly
**Neutral Palette** (gray, beige, white): Sophisticated, flexible, timeless

### Saturation Hierarchy
```
High saturation: Primary actions only (< 10% of surface)
Medium saturation: Secondary UI, accents (10-20%)
Low saturation: Backgrounds, containers (70-80%)
Near-zero: Text, borders, dividers
```

---

## Layout Principles

### The Rule of Thirds
Divide space into 3x3 grid. Place key elements at intersections.
```
Use for: Hero sections, image placement, focal points
```

### The Golden Ratio (1:1.618)
Natural proportion that feels balanced.
```
Use for: Width/height relationships, spacing progression
Example: If width is 800px, height might be 494px
```

### The F-Pattern
Users scan in F shape: top-left → right → down-left → right.
```
Use for: Content pages, dashboards, text-heavy layouts
Place critical info: Top-left, left edge, first two lines
```

### The Z-Pattern
Users scan in Z: top-left → top-right → bottom-left → bottom-right.
```
Use for: Landing pages, single-action pages, ads
Place CTA: Bottom-right (end of Z)
```

---

## Component Patterns

### Cards
**Stripe style**: Subtle shadow, generous padding, rounded corners
**Linear style**: Border only, minimal padding, square corners
**Apple style**: No visible container, grouped by space

### Buttons
**Primary**: Filled, high contrast, clear action
**Secondary**: Outlined or ghost, lower visual weight
**Tertiary**: Text only, for less important actions
```
Sizing: 32px (small), 40px (default), 48px (large)
Padding: Height / 2 horizontally, text centered
```

### Data Tables
**Dense**: Minimal padding, alternating rows, borders
**Spacious**: Generous padding, divider lines only, grouped headers
**Card-based**: Each row as card, works for fewer items

### Forms
**Stacked**: Label above, full-width input (best for mobile)
**Inline**: Label left, input right (good for dense forms)
**Floating**: Label inside input, floats up on focus (modern feel)
```
Input height: 40-48px
Label size: 14px
Spacing between fields: 16-24px
```
