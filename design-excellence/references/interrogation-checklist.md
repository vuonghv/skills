## Typography

- [ ] Is there a clear type hierarchy (headline → subhead → body → caption)?
- [ ] Are font sizes creating appropriate contrast? (Minimum 1.5x ratio between levels)
- [ ] Is line-height optimal? (1.4-1.6 for body, 1.1-1.3 for headlines)
- [ ] Are line lengths readable? (45-75 characters for body text)
- [ ] Is letter-spacing adjusted for large type? (Tighten headlines, loosen small caps)
- [ ] Are font weights creating visual rhythm without chaos?
- [ ] Is there unnecessary font variation? (Limit to 2 families, 3-4 weights max)
- [ ] Does the type feel distinctive or default? Consider: geometric sans, humanist, modern serif

## Color

- [ ] Is the palette intentional or arbitrary? (3-5 colors max, clear roles)
- [ ] Do colors have assigned functions? (Primary action, secondary, accent, neutrals)
- [ ] Is contrast sufficient for accessibility? (4.5:1 for body, 3:1 for large text)
- [ ] Are grays warm or cool intentionally? (Match overall temperature)
- [ ] Is there a dominant color creating unity?
- [ ] Are accent colors used sparingly for maximum impact?
- [ ] Does the palette evoke the right emotion? (Cool=professional, warm=approachable)
- [ ] Are there any colors that feel arbitrary or distracting?

## Layout & Spacing

- [ ] Is there a visible grid system? (4px, 8px, or 12px base unit)
- [ ] Is spacing consistent and mathematical? (Multiples of base unit)
- [ ] Is there enough white space? (When in doubt, add more)
- [ ] Are elements aligned to a clear structure?
- [ ] Is the density appropriate? (Not cramped, not sparse)
- [ ] Are margins and padding creating breathing room?
- [ ] Is negative space being used as a design element?
- [ ] Would the layout benefit from asymmetry?

## Visual Hierarchy

- [ ] Is the most important element immediately obvious?
- [ ] Can the eye follow a clear path through the content?
- [ ] Is hierarchy achieved through size, weight, color, AND position?
- [ ] Are secondary elements clearly subordinate?
- [ ] Is there appropriate visual tension and rest?
- [ ] Do groupings make logical and visual sense?
- [ ] Is repetition creating rhythm without monotony?

## Content & Clarity

- [ ] Can the main message be understood in 3 seconds?
- [ ] Is there unnecessary text that could be cut?
- [ ] Are labels clear without being verbose?
- [ ] Is information density appropriate for the context?
- [ ] Are icons/visuals clarifying or decorating?
- [ ] Is every element earning its space?
- [ ] Would simplification strengthen the message?

## Polish & Finish

- [ ] Are corners consistent? (All sharp, all rounded, or intentional mix)
- [ ] Are shadows subtle and consistent in direction?
- [ ] Is there consistent use of borders vs. shadows vs. color fills?
- [ ] Are interactive elements clearly indicated?
- [ ] Do hover/active states feel intentional?
- [ ] Are transitions smooth where they exist?
- [ ] Does every detail feel considered, not default?
- [ ] Would a professional designer approve this?

## Quick Pre-Delivery Check

Before finalizing, verify:

1. **One Thing Stands Out**: There's a clear focal point
2. **Nothing Jars**: No element feels out of place
3. **Feels Intentional**: Every choice appears deliberate
4. **Has Character**: Doesn't look like a template
5. **Serves Purpose**: Design supports, not decorates
